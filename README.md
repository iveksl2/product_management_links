##### Cultivating Positive Relationships with Engineers, Designers
  * The world is awash in 'brilliant visionairies' (often self-labelled) that don't productize much. By definition the do'ers are bringing a vision into a reality and doing the hard real work that has a disproportionate effect on the outcome.  
    * Tips:
      * Find a way to align incentives. If the Product succeeds the engineers should benefit and vice versa with the PM. Not rocket science.
